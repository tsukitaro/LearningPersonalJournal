<p>In real life, we often perform <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3519" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, arithmetic operations are mathematical calculations that can be performed using arithmetic operators. | These operators include addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (\*), division (/), and modulus or remainder (%) operators. Arithmetic operations take two values or operands, with the exception of unary operators such as unary plus (+) and unary minus (-), which take a single value. The order of operation follows the standard arithmetic rules, with multiplication and division having a higher priority level than addition and subtraction. Parentheses can be used to specify the order of execution and for clarity. The unary plus operator indicates a positive value, while the unary minus operator negates a value or an expression.">arithmetic operations</a>. They help us to determine the change from a purchase, calculate the area of a room, count the number of people in a queue, and so on. The same operations are used in programs.</p>

<p>The Java programming language provides operators to perform arithmetic operations:</p>

The subtraction operation can be performed using the '-' operator. For example, in the expression `a - b`, `a` is the minuend and `b` is the subtrahend. It's important to note that the unary minus operator, which is used to indicate a negative value for any type of numeric literal, is different from the subtraction operation.">subtraction</a> <code class="language-java">-</code></p></li><li><p>multiplication <code class="language-java">*</code></p></li><li><p>division <code class="language-java">/</code></p></li><li><p>remainder <code class="language-java">%</code></p></li></ul>
<p>The operators are called binary because they take two values as operands.</p>
<p>The following example prints the results of <strong>addition</strong>, <strong>subtraction</strong>, and <strong>multiplication</strong>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">System.out.println(13 + 25); // prints 38
System.out.println(20 + 70); // prints 90

System.out.println(70 - 30); // prints 40
System.out.println(30 - 70); // prints -40

System.out.println(21 * 3);  // prints 63
System.out.println(20 * 10); // prints 200</code></pre>
<p>The <code class="language-java">/</code> operator returns the integer part of the division of two integer numbers, and any fractional part is discarded.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">System.out.println(8 / 3); // prints 2
System.out.println(41 / 5); // prints 8</code></pre>
<p>The <code class="language-java">%</code> in Java is the modulus or remainder operator. It returns the remainder of the division of two numbers. Note, that when the dividend is less than the divisor, the quotient is zero and the remainder equals the dividend.

<pre><code class="language-kotlin">System.out.println(10 % 3); // prints 1, because 10 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 1
System.out.println(12 % 4); // prints 0, because 12 divided by 4 leaves no remainder
System.out.println(5 % 9); // prints 5, because 5 divided by 9 leaves a remainder of 5</code></pre>

A lambda expression, specifically, is an anonymous function that can be assigned to a variable. Its general form consists of a list of parameters followed by the body of the function. The body can return a value. Lambda expressions are particularly useful when you want to pass a small function as a parameter to a method, or when you want to create a function on the fly, without having to define a separate method for it. Unlike a switch statement, which can update the value of a predefined variable, a switch expression evaluates to a specific value and is assigned to a variable.">expressions</a>:</p>
